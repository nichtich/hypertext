<H1>what is silk?</H1>
<B>silk</B> is a web-based hypertext system with a focus on linking.  
silk's design makes linking as easy and frictionless as possible.
silk was created as a personal notetaking tool---it is perfect for recording ideas and the connections between them---but it can also be used for mult-user collaboration, much in the same way as a <A HREF="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb">Wiki</A>.

The core idea is that links are important.  
A well-linked hypertext can be much more valuable than a poorly-linked hypertext.
Links add information to hypertext:  they encode associations and relationships.
We can include this information explicitly in the text itself, but links are more useful than pure-text references because they are much easier to follow.
In theory, linking is not a difficult task, as it follows directly from our natural inclination to notice connections between pieces of information.
We find it easy to determine what should be linked.
Creating and maintaining links, on the other hand, is generally more difficult.<BR>
<BR>
The best way to understand silk is to try it:  the <A HREF="http://hypertext.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/silk.pl">silk Sandbox</A> is open to the public.

<H1>what makes linking difficult?</H1> 
In most hypertext systems, to link to a document, you must first obtain that document's identifier, be it a URL (http://www.somewhere...), a node number, or a camel case document title (CanYouRememberThisTitle).
Then, you must select or create an appropriate text region as an anchor for the link (for example, <A HREF="http://www.google.com">a piece of text</A> in the middle of your document).
Finally, you must encode the anchored link using some kind of syntax (&lt;A HREF = "http://www.somewhere...").
These steps take time.
The time commitment discourages link creation in the first place, not to mention making link maintenence difficult.
Since most hypertext systems force links to be anchored to text regions, links can clutter the text and make it difficult to read---yet another factor discouraging well-linked hypertexts.
Furthermore, by forcing links to be anchored, these hypertext systems make bidirectional linking akward at best and impossible at worst.

<H1>how does silk make linking easy?</H1>
In a silk web, an anchorless, bidirectional link can be created with a single mouse click.
Optional link anchors can be specified around text regions using a straight-forward syntax (three characters to start the link region and four characters to end it).
Internal linking never requires knowlege of document identifiers.
silk webs also support links to the external web, which of course require URLs as document identifiers.
However, a URL can be entered once and used over and over throughout a silk web:  after creating an external link, it can be connected to an internal silk node with a single mouse click.    


<H1>how do i use silk?</H1>

Though silk was designed to be easy to use and understand, there are a few subtleties.
The <A HREF="userGuide.shtml">silk User's Guide</A> provides a complete description of the various features. 


<H1>how can i run my own silk web?</H1>

You need a web server that supports CGI scripts written in Perl.
If you have such a web server, you can probably run silk (if you think you are missing required Perl modules, take a look at the list of <A HREF="requirements.shtml">software requirements</A>).<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="">Download the script</A> (v0.1), place it in your server's cgi-bin directory, and make sure your script is executable by your web server (for example, <TT>chmod o+x silk.pl</TT>).
You also need to create a directory where silk will store its data (for example, <TT>cgi-data/silk</TT>).
This data directory needs to be writeable/executable by your web server.

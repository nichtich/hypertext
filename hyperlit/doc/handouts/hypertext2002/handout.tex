\begin{abstract}
What kind of monolithic hypertext system can be created in a single night of coding?
\end{abstract}


\section{What is it?}
hyperlit is a small Java application for authoring literary hypertext.


\section{What is it not?}
hyperlit is similar (in a very weak sense) to Storyspace.  However, it is not as powerful as Storyspace in that it does not provide spatial views of a hypertext.  Then again, Storyspace costs \$295 and has been developed over many years, while hyperlit is free and was developed in a single night.

\section{What can it do?}
hyperlit is expressive enough to write substantial literary hypertext, as long as the final product does not require a spatial view.  For example, one could use it to author a work as substantial as ``afternoon, a story'', the flagship hypertext for Storyspace.

\section{What else can it do?}
hyperlit can export hypertext lexia as a network of HTML pages for the web.

\section{Where is an example?}
``six and a half seconds, a story'' was authored with hyperlit (during that same night that hyperlit was coded) and has been exported for the web.  To read this story, go to

\section{What do I need to run it?}
hyperlit requires Java 1.2 or later.

\section{Who is responsible?}
hyperlit was coded in a single night by Jason Rohrer.
